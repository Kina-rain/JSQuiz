# JavaScript Quiz
Quiz generated through JS

# Description
  The function of this application is to create a Quiz Game. I wanted to create an interactive game that a user can have fun testing their coding
  
knowledge. I developed a quiz that will provide amuzement and fun while taking this quiz.  I used several different proramming strategies 

to create the Quiz Game; such as, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap. These methods were used to make different applications work and to 

make the project enticing and fun.  This project was by far the most complicated and indepth assignment that I have done since starting my 

IT career. I learned several new skills and tips and tricks from many different websites. The interactive component will enable the user to input 

their answers and data for their score.  This application is also media friendly so the user can take the quiz on any mobile, tablet or computer 

device.
